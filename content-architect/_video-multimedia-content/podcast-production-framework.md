## Prompt

You are a podcast strategist and production architect designing a comprehensive audio content program for **{{company_name}}**, operating in **{{industry_vertical}}**. Your task is to create a scalable podcast system that achieves **{{podcast_objective}}** by engaging **{{target_audience}}** through strategic content planning, professional production workflows, multi-platform distribution, and data-driven audience growth tactics that demonstrate measurable business impact.

### Podcast Concept & Positioning

**Podcast Naming Strategy:**

Your podcast name should be:
- **Descriptive**: Signals what the show is about without requiring explanation
- **Memorable**: Easy to recall and spell
- **Searchable**: Contains keywords relevant to your topic
- **Unique**: Differentiates from competitors in the space
- **On-Brand**: Aligns with company voice and positioning

**Naming Frameworks:**

1. **Descriptive + Category**: "[Topic] + [Podcast/Show/Conversations]"
   - Examples: "The Marketing Architects Podcast", "SaaS Breakthrough Conversations"

2. **Provocative Question**: "How [Desired Outcome]?"
   - Examples: "How I Built This", "How to Build a Great Workplace"

3. **Aspirational State**: "The [Desired Identity] Show"
   - Examples: "The Tim Ferriss Show", "The Growth Show"

4. **Industry Insider**: "[Industry] + [Insider Term]"
   - Examples: "Acquired" (M&A podcast), "Invest Like the Best"

5. **Creative/Metaphorical**: Abstract name with strong brand identity
   - Examples: "Masters of Scale", "StartUp" (requires more marketing to clarify topic)

**Show Description Formula:**

```
[Hook: What unique value does this show provide?]

[Target Audience: Who should listen?]

[Format & Cadence: What to expect (interviews, solo, frequency)]

[Host Credentials: Why should listeners trust the host?]

[Call-to-Action: Subscribe, follow, rate & review]
```

**Example for B2B SaaS Company:**
```
Marketing Architects: The show where B2B marketing leaders share the strategies, systems, and frameworks behind their fastest-growing campaigns.

Each week, host Sarah Chen interviews CMOs and demand gen experts from high-growth companies about what's working NOW—not theory, but tactical playbooks you can implement tomorrow.

Perfect for marketing directors, demand gen managers, and growth marketers who want to skip the fluff and get straight to actionable insights.

Hosted by Sarah Chen, former VP of Marketing at TechCo (0 to $50M ARR) and current CMO at MarketingSaaS.

**Competitive Differentiation:**

Analyze **{{competitive_podcasts}}** to identify:
- **Content Gaps**: Topics they don't cover that your audience wants
- **Format Differentiation**: If everyone does interviews, consider solo commentary or narrative
- **Length Opportunities**: If competitors average 60min, test if 30min focused episodes resonate
- **Audience Niche**: Serve a subsegment better than broad competitors
- **Production Quality**: Meet or exceed production standards in your category
- **Unique Angle**: Insider access, contrarian viewpoints, underrepresented voices, specific methodology

### Production Workflow & Technical Setup

**Recording Setup by {{equipment_level}}:**

**Basic Setup ($200-500):**
- **Microphone**: Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB or Samson Q2U (~$80)
  - USB connection for simplicity
  - Cardioid pattern (picks up voice, not room noise)
- **Headphones**: Audio-Technica ATH-M30x (~$70)
  - Closed-back to prevent audio bleed
- **Recording Software**: Audacity (free) or GarageBand (Mac, free)
- **Remote Interviews**: Zoom (record separate audio tracks) or Riverside.fm
- **Boom Arm + Pop Filter**: ~$30-50 (reduces desk bumps and plosives)
- **Best For**: Solopreneurs, startups, testing podcast viability

**Intermediate Setup ($500-2000):**
- **Microphone**: Shure SM7B (~$400) or Rode PodMic (~$100)
  - XLR connection (better quality than USB)
- **Audio Interface**: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 or Rodecaster Pro II (~$200-700)
  - Converts XLR to digital, provides preamp
- **Headphones**: Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (~$160)
- **Recording Software**: Adobe Audition, Logic Pro, or Hindenburg Journalist
- **Remote Interviews**: Riverside.fm or SquadCast (studio-quality remote recording)
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Foam panels or portable vocal booth (~$100-300)
- **Best For**: Established brands, regular publishing, professional quality expectations

**Professional Setup ($2000-10000+):**
- **Microphone**: Neumann TLM 103, Shure SM7B with CloudLifter, or Rode NTG5
- **Audio Interface**: Universal Audio Apollo Twin or RME Babyface Pro (~$700-900)
- **Mixer**: Rodecaster Pro II or Behringer X32 (for multi-guest in-studio)
- **Monitoring**: Multiple headphone amps for guests
- **Recording Software**: Pro Tools, Logic Pro X with professional plugins
- **Studio Space**: Acoustically treated dedicated room
- **Video Capture**: Multiple cameras for video podcast versions
- **Best For**: High-profile shows, video podcasts, shows with in-studio guests

**Remote Recording Best Practices:**

**For Guests:**
- **Pre-Interview Tech Check**: 10min call prior to recording to test audio
- **Environment Guidance**: Quiet room, close windows, silence phones/notifications
- **Headphone Requirement**: Mandatory to prevent echo
- **Ethernet Over WiFi**: If possible, wired connection for stability
- **Local Recording Backup**: Have guest record locally as backup

**For Host:**
- **Platform Choice**:
  - Riverside.fm or SquadCast: Studio-quality local recording (each participant recorded separately)
  - Zoom: Acceptable, record separate audio tracks (not single mixed track)
  - Avoid: Phone calls, Skype (lower quality)
- **Separate Track Recording**: Essential for editing flexibility (can't remove guest background noise from mixed track)

**Recording Session Checklist:**
- [ ] Test microphone levels (speak at normal volume, aim for -12dB to -6dB peaks)
- [ ] Silent room (no fans, AC, traffic)
- [ ] Notifications off (phone, computer, Slack)
- [ ] Water nearby (avoid dry mouth clicks)
- [ ] Outline/questions visible but not rustling paper
- [ ] Hit record and wait 5 seconds of silence before speaking (easier to edit)
- [ ] Record 30sec "room tone" at end (for editing seamless transitions)

### Post-Production & Editing

**Editing Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Raw Audio Cleanup (Day 1)**
1. **Import & Organize**: All audio tracks into project, label clearly
2. **Sync Tracks**: Align guest and host audio (clap or count to sync)
3. **Noise Reduction**: Remove background hum, AC, room tone
4. **Remove Unwanted Content**:
   - Pre-show chatter
   - Long pauses (>2 seconds)
   - Coughs, sneezes, interruptions
   - Off-topic tangents (unless gold)
   - Ums, ahs (sparingly—too much editing sounds robotic)
   - False starts and repeats

**Phase 2: Structure & Flow (Day 2)**
5. **Rearrange If Needed**: Sometimes better stories emerge out of order
6. **Add Transitions**: If cutting large sections, add bridge narration
7. **Pacing Optimization**: Tighten dialogue, remove dead air, but maintain natural rhythm
8. **Sound Leveling**: Normalize volume across speakers (guest and host should be same loudness)

**Phase 3: Production Elements (Day 3)**
9. **Music & Sound**:
   - Intro music (15-30sec): Establishes brand, energizes
   - Outro music (15-30sec): Signals end, call-to-action moment
   - Transition music (optional, 5sec): Between segments
   - Sound effects (sparingly): Emphasis or humor
   - Source: Epidemic Sound, Artlist, AudioJungle (royalty-free)
10. **Ad Insertion Points**:
   - Pre-roll (beginning): Sponsorship or company message
   - Mid-roll (middle): Natural break in content
   - Post-roll (end): Typically lowest completion, use for secondary CTAs
11. **Intro/Outro Voiceover**:
   - Episode-specific intro (30-60sec): What's in this episode
   - Standard outro (30sec): Subscribe, rate, follow, next episode

**Phase 4: Quality Control (Day 4)**
12. **Full Listen**: Host or producer listens to entire episode
13. **Fix Issues**: Any audio glitches, pacing problems, content errors
14. **Transcript Generation**: AI-generated (Descript, Otter.ai) then human-reviewed
15. **Metadata Preparation**: Title, description, show notes, timestamps

## Best Practices

- **Front-Load Value**: First 30 seconds determine if listener continues; hook with compelling promise
- **Invest in Audio Quality**: Good audio is non-negotiable; listeners forgive imperfect content but not bad sound
- **Show Notes Matter**: Comprehensive show notes improve SEO, user experience, and shareability
- **Guest Preparation**: Pre-interview calls and detailed briefs lead to better conversations
- **Listener-Centric Content**: Create for audience needs, not just what you want to say
- **Repurpose Relentlessly**: Extract maximum value from each episode through multi-format distribution
- **Build Relationships**: Treat guests as long-term relationships, not transactional interviews
- **Measure What Matters**: Track metrics aligned to business goals, not just vanity downloads
- **Iterate Based on Data**: Let listener behavior and feedback inform content adjustments

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Inconsistent Publishing**: Sporadic releases destroy listener habit formation and algorithm favorability
- **Meandering Conversations**: Unstructured interviews without clear narrative arc bore listeners
- **Poor Audio Quality**: Background noise, echo, low volume make shows unlistenable regardless of content
- **Weak Hooks**: Boring first 30 seconds cause immediate abandonment
- **Neglecting Promotion**: "Build it and they will come" doesn't work; even great shows need marketing
- **No Call-to-Action**: Failing to guide listeners to next action (subscribe, rate, visit website, etc.)
- **Guest Over-Dependence**: Relying entirely on guest promotion without own audience-building
- **Ignoring Analytics**: Not reviewing performance data to understand what resonates
- **Over-Scripting**: Robotic delivery from reading scripts verbatim; outline is better
- **Premature Quitting**: Giving up before 20-30 episodes (when traction typically begins)
