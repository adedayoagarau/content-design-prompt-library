## Advocate Program Framework v1.0

**Purpose**: Design a strategic, scalable customer advocacy program that transforms satisfied customers into brand ambassadors, content creators, and referral drivers through structured engagement frameworks, tiered recognition systems, and measurable business impact that generates authentic word-of-mouth, reduces CAC by 30-50%, and increases customer lifetime value through deepened loyalty and community belonging.

**Context**: Use this framework when building formal customer advocacy, ambassador, or champion programs for established brands with engaged customer bases. Ideal for B2B SaaS creating customer advisory boards, consumer brands building influencer networks, or product companies fostering user communities. Applies to referral programs, beta testing groups, community moderators, content contributors, event organizers, and customer success story participants across B2B, B2C, and marketplace models.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Advocacy Maturity Model** - Passive customer → Satisfied → Engaged → Advocate → Ambassador
- **Value Exchange Framework** - Recognition, access, influence, rewards balanced with asks
- **Tiered Membership Design** - Progressive benefits and responsibilities as advocates level up
- **Community-Led Growth Engine** - Advocates as acquisition, retention, and expansion drivers
- **Social Capital Theory** - Status, reputation, and belonging as motivational drivers
- **Advocacy Attribution Modeling** - Tracking advocate impact on pipeline, revenue, retention

## Common Pitfalls

- **All Take, No Give**: Asking advocates to promote without providing value (recognition, access, rewards)
- **No Clear Value Proposition**: Advocates don't understand "What's in it for me?"
- **Over-Complicated Structure**: Too many tiers, points rules, confusing progression
- **Neglecting Top Performers**: Not recognizing or engaging your most active advocates
- **Treating Advocates as Marketing Tools**: Transactional relationships instead of genuine partnerships
- **No Community**: Isolated advocates without peer connections or shared identity
- **Inconsistent Engagement**: Launching program then going silent for months
- **Poor Attribution Tracking**: Can't prove advocate ROI to justify investment
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Not segmenting advocates by motivation (recognition vs. rewards vs. influence)
- **Ignoring Feedback**: Advocates provide product insights but aren't heard
