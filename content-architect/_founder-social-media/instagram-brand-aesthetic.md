### Photography & Visual Style

**Photography Aesthetic Defined:**

**Lighting:**
- Natural light (bright, airy, authentic)
- Studio/controlled (polished, consistent)
- Moody/dramatic (shadows, contrast)
- Golden hour (warm, aspirational)

**Composition:**
- Rule of thirds (dynamic, professional)

- Flat lay (organized, product-focused)
- Candid/action (authentic, documentary)

**Color Grading/Filters:**
- Warm tones (inviting, energetic)
- Cool tones (calm, professional)
- Desaturated (editorial, sophisticated)
- Vibrant (playful, attention-grabbing)

**Subject Matter:**
- Founder-forward (face visible 60%+ of posts)
- Product-focused (merchandise/service hero shots)
- Lifestyle-integrated (product/work in daily life context)
- Abstract/conceptual (graphics, quotes, illustrations)

**Editing Consistency:**
- Use same filter/preset on all photos
- Or manual editing with consistent: Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, Temperature, Tint
- Tools: VSCO presets, Lightroom mobile presets, Snapseed, Unfold

**Example Aesthetic Combinations:**

**Vibrant Creator:**

- Varied compositions (dynamic, energetic)
- Lots of movement, personality

### Grid Strategy & Planning

**Why Grid Matters:**
- Profile visitors see 9 posts at a time
- Grid is first impression (cohesive = professional, chaotic = amateur)
- Strategic planning ensures individual posts work + collective aesthetic flows

**Grid Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Checkerboard**
```
[Founder Photo] [Graphic] [Product]
[Graphic] [Founder] [Graphic]
[Product] [Graphic] [Founder]
```
- Pros: Visually dynamic, easy to maintain
- Cons: Can feel busy

**Pattern 2: Row Themes**
```
Row 1: [Founder] [Founder] [Founder]
Row 2: [Product] [Product] [Product]
Row 3: [Graphic] [Graphic] [Graphic]
```
- Pros: Clear organization, thematic
- Cons: Less visual variety per row

**Pattern 3: Column Themes**
```
Col 1: Founder photos
Col 2: Graphics/carousels
Col 3: Product/lifestyle
```
- Pros: Variety across, consistency down
- Cons: Harder to plan

**Pattern 4: Cohesive Aesthetic (No Strict Pattern)**
```
[Any content type]
  BUT
Unified by: Consistent colors, filters, fonts, style
```
- Pros: Most flexible, sustainable, authentic
- Cons: Requires strong aesthetic eye
- Recommended for most founders

**Grid Planning Tools:**
- Preview App (plan grid, drag/drop, see how it looks)
- Planoly
- Later
- UNUM

**Planning Process:**
1. Design/capture next 9 posts
2. Arrange in Preview app to see grid view
3. Adjust order for visual flow
4. Ensure color balance (not all blue posts in one row)
5. Schedule or save order

### Content Format Visual Systems

**Feed Post Design System:**

**Template Types:**

**Type 1: Quote/Text Graphic**
```
Background: {{color_palette[primary]}}
Text: {{typography[headline]}}
Accent: Small logo or icon
```
- Use: Inspirational, thought leadership, announcements
- Frequency: 20-30% of feed

**Type 2: Photo + Text Overlay**
```
Photo: Founder or product
Overlay: Semi-transparent color block
Text: Headline or key message
```
- Use: Announcements with personality
- Frequency: 20% of feed

**Type 3: Pure Photography**
```
High-quality photo
Minimal/no text overlay
Let image speak
```
- Use: Lifestyle, behind-the-scenes, aesthetic shots
- Frequency: 30-40% of feed

**Type 4: Carousel Graphics**
```
Consistent multi-slide design
Slide 1: Bold cover
Slides 2-9: Information delivery
Slide 10: CTA
```
- Use: Educational content, frameworks, listicles
- Frequency: 10-20% of feed

**Reel Visual Style:**

**Opening Frame:**
- Must hook in 1 second
- High contrast, movement, or face
- Text overlay with compelling headline

**Throughout:**
- Fast cuts every 2-4 seconds
- Consistent text overlay font/color
- Brand colors in wardrobe/background when possible
- Maintain aspect ratio 9:16 (vertical full-screen)

**Closing Frame:**
- CTA text overlay
- Subtle branded element (logo, handle)

**Story Design System:**

**Story Template Elements:**
- Branded background (solid color from palette or subtle pattern)
- Consistent text placement (top third or bottom third)
- Sticker usage (polls, questions, sliders in brand colors if possible)
- Story highlight covers (all matching style)

**Story Highlight Covers:**
```
Design once, use forever:
- Circular (fits Instagram's circle frame)
- Icon + label OR photo + label
- Consistent background color
- Same font for all labels
```

**Template Examples (Canva):**
- Create 5-7 highlight cover templates
- "About" - profile icon
- "BTS" - camera icon
- "Products" - shopping bag icon
- "Press" - newspaper icon
- "FAQ" - question mark icon

### Template Creation for Scalability

**Why Templates Matter:**
- Consistency without redesigning every post
- Faster content creation (2 hours → 30 minutes)
- Professional look maintained even with limited design skills

**Creating Template System in Canva:**

**Step 1: Set Up Brand Kit**
- Upload {{color_palette}} (all hex codes)
- Upload {{typography}} fonts
- Upload logo variations (if applicable)

**Step 2: Design Master Templates (5-7 types)**
1. Quote graphic template
2. Announcement template
3. Carousel cover + content slides
4. Story template
5. Highlight cover template
6. Reel thumbnail template
7. Product feature template (if applicable)

**Step 3: Create Variations**
- Same template, different colors from palette
- Gives variety while maintaining cohesion

**Step 4: Duplicate & Customize**
- For each new post, duplicate template
- Swap text, images
- Export and post

**Time Investment:**
- Initial setup: 3-5 hours
- Per post after: 15-30 minutes
- ROI: Massive time savings + consistency

### Mobile-First Design Principles

**Why Mobile-First Matters:**
- 95%+ of Instagram users on mobile
- Small screen = different design rules
- Thumb-stopping power required

**Mobile Optimization Checklist:**

**1. Text Size:**
- Test on actual phone—if you squint to read, it's too small
- Minimum body text: 18pt on 1080x1080 canvas
- Minimum headline: 36pt

**2. High Contrast:**
- Light text on dark background OR dark text on light background
- Avoid: Gray text on gray background, yellow on white

**3. Negative Space:**
- Don't fill every pixel
- Breathing room makes design readable
- 20-30% of canvas should be "empty"

**4. Focal Point:**
- One clear main element
- Eye should know where to look immediately
- Avoid: Everything competing for attention

**5. Preview Consideration:**
- Instagram feed shows preview with profile pic covering bottom left
- Don't put important info in bottom left corner
- Design knowing only ~80% of image fully visible in feed scroll

### Authenticity vs. Polish Balance

**The Tension:**
- Too polished = Feels corporate, unapproachable, fake
- Too raw = Feels amateur, unprofessional, low-effort

**The Sweet Spot:**
- Consistent aesthetic (colors, fonts) = Professional
- Real photos, genuine moments = Authentic
- Thoughtful design without over-production = Balanced

**Tactics for Authentic Polish:**
- Use templates for graphics, but real photos for Stories
- Imperfect moments (outtakes, bloopers) within consistent color grading
- Professional design for carousels, candid iPhone photos for daily posts
- Behind-the-scenes content showing creation process (meta content about making content)

**Example:** Polished carousel educational post (template-designed, color-coded, branded) followed by Story showing founder actually creating that carousel (phone propped on desk, messy workspace, voiceover explaining process)

### Aesthetic Evolution & Refresh

**When to Evolve Your Aesthetic:**
- Rebrand / Pivot (new company direction)
- Audience shift (targeting different demographic)
- Personal growth (your style matured)
- Current aesthetic not performing (low engagement, follower drops)
- Bi-annual refresh (subtle updates to stay current)

**How to Evolve Without Losing Brand:**
- Update gradually (not overnight rebrand)
- Keep some elements (if colors change, keep typography OR vice versa)
- Archive old posts if drastically different (create Highlight or move to archive)
- Announce change with post explaining evolution

**2024 Instagram Aesthetic Trends to Consider:**
- Dopamine colors (bright, saturated, joyful)
- Anti-aesthetic (intentional imperfection, raw)
- Maximalism (bold, busy, pattern-heavy)
- Retro/Vintage (70s/80s/90s throwbacks)
- Minimalist 2.0 (clean but warmer than sterile minimalism)

Choose based on {{brand_personality}} and {{target_audience}}, not just trends.
