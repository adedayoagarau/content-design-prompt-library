## Instagram Stories Framework & Daily Engagement System v1.0

**Purpose**: Design a comprehensive Instagram Stories strategy that transforms ephemeral content into a powerful daily engagement engine, building intimate founder-audience relationships, driving profile-to-follower conversions, and creating consistent touchpoints that support business objectives through authentic, interactive content.

**Context**: Use this framework when developing a systematic approach to Instagram Stories as a core founder brand-building tool. While Feed posts are your portfolio, Stories are your daily conversation—accounting for 500M+ daily users and often higher engagement than Feed. Stories excel at humanization, real-time updates, behind-the-scenes access, and two-way dialogue. Ideal for founders who want to build loyal communities, not just passive followers, and who can commit to daily Story presence (5-15 Stories/day).

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Daily Touchpoint Architecture** - Systematic presence building through consistent, valuable Story sequences
- **Interactive Engagement Model** - Two-way conversation through polls, questions, quizzes, sliders
- **Ephemeral Content Strategy** - Leveraging 24-hour lifespan for authenticity and urgency
- **Highlight Curation System** - Transforming best Stories into permanent content library
- **Intimacy Ladder Framework** - Progressive relationship deepening through Story vulnerability and access
- **Algorithmic Story Ranking** - Optimizing for Instagram's Story distribution and prioritization signals

## Prompt

You are a strategic Instagram Stories architect designing a daily engagement system for **{{founder_name}}**, founder of **{{company_name}}**. Your task is to create a sustainable, authentic Stories framework that builds intimate audience relationships, drives **{{primary_goal}}**, and positions them as an accessible, trustworthy authority in **{{industry_category}}** through consistent, valuable, and interactive content within their **{{availability}}** daily time budget.

### Stories Strategic Foundation

**Why Stories Matter for Founders:**
- **Algorithm Priority**: Stories appear at top of app, ensuring visibility
- **Ephemeral = Authentic**: 24-hour lifespan reduces pressure for perfection, encourages real, raw content
- **Daily Touchpoints**: Consistent presence builds familiarity and trust faster than weekly Feed posts
- **Interaction Depth**: Polls, questions, quizzes, sliders drive higher engagement than Feed likes
- **Intimacy Premium**: Stories feel personal (direct-to-camera), creating parasocial relationships
- **Conversion Power**: Link stickers (10K+ followers), DM prompts, swipe-ups drive action
- **Highlight Permanence**: Best Stories can be saved as evergreen Highlights

**Stories vs. Feed:**
- Feed = Portfolio (polished, permanent, discovery)
- Stories = Conversation (casual, ephemeral, relationship-building)
- Feed = "What I want new followers to see"
- Stories = "What I want existing followers to experience daily"

### Daily Stories Architecture

**Optimal Story Sequence Structure:**

Design a daily flow that balances value, engagement, and business goals:

**Opening Story (Story 1-2):**
- **Purpose**: Hook viewers to keep watching
- **Content**: Surprising fact, teaser, question, relatable observation
- **Format**: Face-to-camera greeting OR text on visual
- **Example**: "Just realized something about {{industry_category}} that nobody talks about... (swipe)"

**Value/Content Stories (Stories 3-7):**
- **Purpose**: Deliver on the promise of the hook
- **Content**: Teaching, storytelling, behind-the-scenes, insights
- **Format**: Mix of talking head, screen recordings, product demos, workspace shots
- **Example**: "Here's the 3-part framework I use... (Story 3: Part 1, Story 4: Part 2, etc.)"

**Interactive Stories (Stories 8-10):**
- **Purpose**: Convert passive viewers into active participants
- **Content**: Polls, questions, quizzes, sliders, "This or That"
- **Format**: Branded templates with clear prompts
- **Example**: "Poll: Which topic should I cover tomorrow? A) Fundraising, B) Hiring"

**Social Proof Stories (Stories 11-13):**
- **Purpose**: Build credibility through external validation
- **Content**: Customer testimonials, press mentions, user wins, team highlights
- **Format**: Reshares of mentions, screenshot testimonials, tagged content
- **Example**: Reshare customer post with comment: "This is why we build 🙏"

**Personal/Lifestyle Stories (Stories 14-16):**
- **Purpose**: Humanize the founder, balance professional with personal
- **Content**: Coffee routine, workout, family (within {{vulnerability_comfort}}), hobbies
- **Format**: Casual, unscripted, in-the-moment captures
- **Example**: "Morning run before the chaos begins ☀️" (aligned with {{vulnerability_comfort}} level)

**CTA/Closing Story (Story 17-18):**
- **Purpose**: Direct next action aligned with {{primary_goal}}
- **Content**: Link to blog/product/newsletter, DM prompt, profile visit encouragement
- **Format**: Clear, singular focus (don't ask for 5 things)
- **Example**: "Link in bio to join 5,000 founders getting my weekly playbook 📬"

**Total**: 12-18 Stories/day (high engagement), adjust to {{availability}}

**Time-Based Story Batches:**

For optimal reach across {{audience_timezone}}:

**Morning Batch (7-9am local):**
- 5-7 Stories: Morning routine, daily intentions, quick tip, poll
- Why: Commuters, early risers checking phone
- Content: Energizing, motivational, light

**Midday Batch (12-2pm local):**
- 3-5 Stories: Work updates, behind-the-scenes, industry commentary
- Why: Lunch break scrollers
- Content: Educational, entertaining, quick-hit value

**Evening Batch (6-9pm local):**
- 4-6 Stories: Reflections, wins/lessons, personal content, Q&A responses
- Why: Peak usage time, relaxed scrolling
- Content: Deeper, more personal, community-focused

**Consistency > Volume**: Better to post 5-7 quality Stories daily than 20 sporadic, low-value ones.

### Interactive Sticker Strategy

**Polls:**
- **Use cases**: Quick opinions, content direction, fun engagement
- **Best practices**:
  - Ask genuinely useful questions (not just "Do you like this?")
  - Share results in next Story ("80% of you said yes, so here's...")
  - Use for product decisions when appropriate (builds buy-in)
- **Examples**:
  - "Should I deep-dive this topic or move on?"
  - "Which challenge resonates more? A or B?"
  - "Raising prices: Fair or greedy?"

**Questions:**
- **Use cases**: AMAs, content ideas, feedback, personal connection
- **Best practices**:
  - Answer thoughtfully in subsequent Stories
  - Give credit ("Great question from @username")
  - Set boundaries ("I'll answer business Qs, not personal finance advice")
- **Examples**:
  - "What's your #1 {{industry_category}} question?"
  - "What would you build if you started over?"
  - "Submit your biggest challenge—I'll solve one per week"

**Quizzes:**
- **Use cases**: Educational content, product knowledge, fun engagement
- **Best practices**:
  - Keep it light (not condescending if they get it wrong)
  - Educate in the answer explanation
  - Tie to your expertise/product
- **Examples**:
  - "Quiz: What % of startups fail in year 1? A) 20%, B) 50%, C) 80%"
  - "Can you guess our new product feature?"
  - "True or False: [Industry myth]"

**Sliders (Emoji Slider):**
- **Use cases**: Opinion intensity, feedback, fun rankings
- **Best practices**:
  - Share average result ("You ranked this 8.2/10 on average!")
  - Use for product/content feedback
  - Make it visual (the emoji matters)
- **Examples**:
  - "How excited are you for this launch? 😴 → 🤯"
  - "Rate your {{industry_category}} knowledge: 🤷 → 🧠"
  - "How stressed are you today? 😌 → 😱"

**Countdowns:**
- **Use cases**: Product launches, events, deadlines, announcements
- **Best practices**:
  - Start 7-14 days before event
  - Build escalating content toward deadline
  - Reminder Stories as countdown nears zero
- **Examples**:
  - "New product drops in... [countdown]"
  - "Early bird pricing ends in... [countdown]"
  - "Announcing our Series A in... [countdown]"

**Link Stickers (10K+ followers only):**
- **Use cases**: Drive traffic to blog, product, newsletter, etc.
- **Best practices**:
  - Clear value proposition ("Read the full framework")
  - Don't overuse (1-2x/day max to avoid seeming salesy)
  - Track clicks with UTM parameters
- **Examples**:
  - "Get the free template 👆"
  - "Read the full case study 📖"
  - "Join 10K founders on the waitlist 🔗"

**"Add Yours" Sticker:**
- **Use cases**: UGC generation, community participation, viral potential

  - Tie to your brand/industry
- **Examples**:
  - "Share your workspace setup #FounderSpaces"
  - "Post your biggest 2024 win so far"
  - "Show your product in the wild"

### Engagement & Community Response

---

## Best Practices

- **Face to Camera Builds Trust**: Founder visibility (not just graphics) creates connection
- **First Story is Hook**: If Story 1 doesn't stop scroll, rest won't be seen
- **Break Up Long Sequences**: Use interactive stickers every 3-5 Stories to re-engage
- **Respond to Every Reply**: Story DMs are gold for relationship building
- **Curate Best into Highlights**: Don't let great content disappear after 24 hours
- **Test Posting Times**: Your audience may be most active at non-obvious times
- **Don't Over-Promote**: Max 20% of Stories should be directly sales-focused
- **Use Text Sparingly**: Too much text = people tap through without reading
- **Vertical Video Optimized**: Fill the screen; horizontal video looks amateur on Stories
- **Sound On or Off**: Design for both (captions for sound-off viewers)

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Posting Just to Post**: Low-value Stories hurt completion rate; quality > quantity
- **No Interactive Elements**: Passive broadcast without stickers = low engagement signal to algorithm
- **Ignoring Story Replies**: Not responding kills future engagement and relationship potential
- **Over-Curated Perfection**: Stories thrive on authenticity; too polished feels inauthentic
- **Inconsistent Posting**: Sporadic Stories don't build habit with audience
- **Too Many Stories**: 20+ low-value Stories = viewer fatigue and exits
- **No Clear CTA**: Stories should guide to next action (DM, link, profile visit)
- **Forgetting Highlights**: Letting best content die after 24hrs instead of archiving
- **Not Tracking Performance**: Posting blind without reviewing what works
- **Copycat Content**: Exact replicas of others' Story formats feel unoriginal
