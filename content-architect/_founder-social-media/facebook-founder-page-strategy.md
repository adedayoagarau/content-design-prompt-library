## Facebook Founder Page Strategy & Business Ecosystem v1.0

**Purpose**: Design a comprehensive Facebook business page strategy for founders that leverages Facebook's massive reach, mature audience demographics, community features, and business tools to drive brand awareness, customer acquisition, and community building through strategic content, engagement, and advertising integration.

**Context**: Use when establishing or optimizing founder presence on Facebook. Despite "Facebook is dead" narratives among younger demographics, it remains dominant for 35+ audiences, B2B decision-makers, local businesses, and community building. 2.9B+ monthly users, sophisticated business tools, and unmatched organic + paid integration make it essential for many founder strategies. Ideal for founders targeting older demographics, local markets, or needing robust advertising platform.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Page Optimization Architecture** - Maximizing page setup for discovery and conversion
- **Content Strategy for Algorithm** - Understanding Facebook's 2024 prioritization (Groups, video, engagement)
- **Community Building Integration** - Linking Page to Groups for deeper engagement
- **Business Tool Leverage** - CRM, Messenger automation, Events, Shop integration
- **Organic + Paid Synergy** - Using page for both organic reach and advertising foundation
- **Cross-Platform Hub Strategy** - Facebook as central community hub linking other channels

### Content Strategy (2024 Algorithm)

**What Facebook Prioritizes:**
1. **Groups content** (highest reach)
2. **Video** (especially Facebook native video, not YouTube links)
3. **Engagement bait... but authentic** (genuine questions work; "comment YES" penalized)
4. **Meaningful interactions** (comments > likes, shares > comments)
5. **Recency** (posting when audience is online)

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Video (native uploads, not links)
- 30% Community engagement (questions, polls, discussion starters)
- 20% Links (blog, products—but know these get deprioritized)
- 10% Photos/text updates

**Video Strategy:**
- Upload directly to Facebook (not YouTube links—algorithm penalizes)
- Length: 1-5 minutes ideal
- Captions required (80% watch without sound)
- First 3 seconds hook (auto-play in feed)

**Engagement-Driving Posts:**
- Questions that spark discussion
- "Fill in the blank" prompts
- Polls (Facebook native poll feature)
- User-generated content requests
- Behind-the-scenes transparency

**Link Posting Strategy:**
- Facebook deprioritizes external links
- Workaround: Post engaging content first, add link in first comment
- Or: Use Facebook's "Link Preview" feature but prioritize native content
- Or: Drive to Messenger instead of website (stays on platform)

### Community Integration (Page + Group Strategy)

**Why Groups Matter:**
- Organic reach on Pages dead (1-5% of followers see posts)
- Groups get 10-20x more reach
- Deeper engagement, community building

**Page + Group Ecosystem:**
- Page: Public-facing brand, entry point, content hub
- Group: Exclusive community for engaged followers
- Funnel: Page post → "Join our Group for..." → Group membership → Deeper relationship

**Example Flow:**
1. Founder posts valuable content on Page
2. CTA in post: "Join our Group for weekly Q&As and exclusive content"
3. Group members more engaged, easier to convert to customers
4. Page continues to attract new people → Group funnel repeat
