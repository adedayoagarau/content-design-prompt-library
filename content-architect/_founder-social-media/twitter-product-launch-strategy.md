## Twitter Product Launch Strategy v1.0

**Purpose**: Orchestrate comprehensive Twitter/X product launch campaigns that maximize visibility, generate buzz, drive conversions, and create sustained momentum through real-time engagement, strategic content sequencing, and community mobilization.

**Context**: Use this framework when launching products, major features, rebrands, or significant company announcements where Twitter is a primary or supporting launch channel. Twitter's real-time, conversation-driven nature makes it ideal for building hype, managing launch day chaos, responding to feedback, and creating viral moments. This framework applies to B2B SaaS, developer tools, consumer apps, or any product where early adopters, tech community, or media are active on Twitter. Best for launches ranging from quiet beta releases to major public announcements requiring 4-8 weeks of campaign orchestration.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Launch Campaign Phasing** - Pre-launch hype, launch day execution, post-launch momentum
- **Real-Time Engagement Strategy** - Managing live conversation, feedback loops, and viral moments
- **FOMO Engineering** - Scarcity, exclusivity, and urgency tactics native to Twitter culture
- **Community Mobilization** - Orchestrating advocates, early adopters, and amplifiers
- **Controversy Navigation** - Handling criticism, competitors, and unexpected responses
- **Algorithmic Momentum** - Leveraging Twitter's recommendation and trending systems

### Example 3: Consumer App Launch (Viral Play)

**Product**: Wellness app for stress management
**Launch Type**: Free download, premium features
**Strategy**: Founder vulnerability + community-driven

**Launch Tweet:**
```
I built Calm Mind because therapy saved my life.

But $200/session isn't accessible.

So I made it $9/month.

CBT techniques. Daily check-ins. Progress tracking.

2,400 beta users. 76% reduced anxiety in 30 days.

**Viral Moment (Day 3):**
```
Calm Mind hit 10,000 users in 72 hours.

I'm crying reading your messages.

"First time I've felt in control in months."
"This app gets me."
"Why didn't this exist sooner?"

Mental health care shouldn't be out of reach.

Thank you for trusting us with your healing ❤️

## Common Pitfalls

- **Announcing Too Early**: Hype dies before launch if timeline too long
- **Over-Promising**: Hype that product can't deliver on damages trust
- **Posting and Ghosting**: Not engaging with replies kills algorithmic boost
- **No Clear CTA**: People excited but don't know how to access product
- **Ignoring Negative Feedback**: Defensive responses backfire publicly
- **Team Radio Silence**: Founder tweets but team says nothing (looks bad)
- **No Post-Launch Plan**: Big launch then silence; momentum evaporates
- **Copying Others' Launch Playbook**: What worked for them may not work for you
- **Launch Day Only on Twitter**: Should be omnichannel (email, PH, blog, etc.)
- **No Metrics Transparency**: Building in public means sharing real numbers
