## LinkedIn Video Content Strategy v1.0

**Purpose**: Design a strategic, scalable video content system for LinkedIn that drives higher engagement, builds authentic connection, and differentiates founder brand through multimedia storytelling—while managing production complexity and resource constraints.

**Context**: Use this framework when incorporating video into LinkedIn content strategy to complement (not replace) text and carousel content. Video on LinkedIn offers unique advantages: face-to-camera builds trust faster, platform prioritizes video in algorithm (though less than 2022-2023), and certain messages land better in motion/voice than text. However, video requires higher production investment and commitment. Ideal for founders comfortable on camera, topics that benefit from demonstration/emotion/personality, and audiences that value founder authenticity. Best approached after establishing consistent posting rhythm (3+ months) and when ready to invest in equipment/editing workflows.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Format-Audience-Message Fit** - Matching video formats to content types and objectives
- **Production Scalability** - Building sustainable workflows that don't require Hollywood budgets
- **Hook-Retain-Convert Video Architecture** - Structure optimized for LinkedIn feed behavior
- **Multi-Format Repurposing** - Video as content hub feeding multiple derivative formats
- **Accessibility-First Design** - Captions and visual clarity as core requirements
- **Authenticity vs. Production Quality Balance** - When polish helps vs. harms

## Prompt

You are a video content strategist designing a comprehensive LinkedIn video system for **{{founder_name}}** that produces **{{video_frequency}}** videos in **{{primary_format}}** format, leveraging **{{production_resources}}** to achieve **{{video_objective}}** through **{{video_style}}** content that drives **{{success_metrics}}**.

### When to Use Video vs. Other Formats

**Video Excels When:**
- ✅ **Personality Matters**: Building personal connection, trust, relatability
- ✅ **Demonstration Required**: Product walkthroughs, process explanations, visual how-tos
- ✅ **Emotion is Key**: Vulnerable stories, passionate opinions, celebration moments
- ✅ **Authority Through Presence**: Executive presence, gravitas, expertise demonstration
- ✅ **Behind-the-Scenes**: Office culture, team dynamics, day-in-the-life

**Text/Carousel Better When:**
- ❌ Complex frameworks requiring detailed reading
- ❌ Data-heavy analysis needing reference-ability
- ❌ Quick insights that don't need elaboration
- ❌ Founder camera-shy or uncomfortable on video
- ❌ Topic doesn't benefit from face/voice

**Strategic Video Allocation:**
If posting 3x/week: 1 video, 1 text, 1 carousel (33% video)
If posting 1x/week: Video every 2-3 weeks (25-33% video)

**Don't Over-Index on Video**: LinkedIn algorithm changes reduced video preference; balance matters.

### LinkedIn Video Formats & Use Cases

**Format 1: Talking Head (Direct-to-Camera)**

**Best For:**
- Personal perspectives and opinions
- Thought leadership statements
- Founder updates and announcements
- Hot takes and industry commentary

**Production:**
- Setup: Camera (phone or webcam), good lighting, clean background
- Length: 60-90 seconds optimal
- Script: Bullet points, not word-for-word (authenticity > perfection)
- Editing: Minimal (jump cuts for ums/pauses acceptable)

**Example Topics:**
- "Here's why I think [industry trend] is overrated"
- "We just hit [milestone]. Here's what it taught me."
- "The biggest mistake I see founders making with [topic]"

**Format 2: Screen Recording + Voiceover**

**Best For:**
- Product demos and walkthroughs
- Tool tutorials and comparisons
- Data analysis and insights
- Framework explanations with slides

**Production:**
- Tools: Loom, Screenflow, Camtasia
- Length: 90-180 seconds (longer acceptable for tutorials)
- Tip: Picture-in-picture (small face box) adds personality
- Editing: Speed up boring parts, add callouts/arrows

**Example Topics:**
- "How we use [tool] to [outcome]"
- "Analyzing our [metrics] dashboard—here's what we learned"
- "Quick tutorial: Setting up [process] in 3 minutes"

**Format 3: B-Roll + Voiceover**

**Best For:**
- Storytelling without being on camera
- Office/team culture showcases
- Product in action
- Event highlights

**Production:**
- Capture: Film relevant footage (team working, product being used, office, event)
- Voiceover: Record narration over footage
- Length: 60-120 seconds
- Editing: More complex (requires cutting footage to voice)

**Example Topics:**
- "A day in the life at [Company]"
- "Watch how our customers use [Product]"
- "Behind the scenes of [Launch/Event]"

**Format 4: Interview/Conversation**

**Best For:**
- Customer testimonials
- Expert guest insights
- Team member spotlights
- Founder-to-founder dialogues

**Production:**
- Setup: Two-camera (or picture-in-picture) or single-cam switching
- Platform: In-person, Zoom/Riverside for remote
- Length: 120-180 seconds (pull best 2-min clip from longer conversation)
- Editing: Cut to highlights, add name/title graphics

**Example Topics:**
- "Our customer [Name] shares how they use [Product]"
- "I asked [Industry Expert] about [Trend]. Here's what they said."
- "Meet [Team Member]: Why they joined and what they're building"

### Video Production Workflow (Scalable System)

**Low-Budget, High-Quality Setup (<$500):**

**Equipment:**
- Camera: iPhone/Android (recent model with good camera)
- Tripod: $30-50 smartphone tripod
- Lighting: $80-150 ring light or softbox
- Microphone: $80-150 Lavalier (wired) or $150-250 wireless (Rode Wireless GO)
- Background: Clean wall, bookshelf, or $50 backdrop

**Software:**
- Editing: CapCut (free, mobile), DaVinci Resolve (free, desktop), or iMovie (free, Mac)
- Captions: CapCut auto-captions, Kapwing, or Descript
- Thumbnails: Canva

**This setup produces professional-looking content for LinkedIn**

**Production Workflow (60-90 min total):**

**Pre-Production (15 min):**
1. Choose topic from content calendar
2. Outline key points (3-5 bullets)
3. Decide format (talking head, screen record, etc.)
4. Set up equipment and location

**Filming (20-30 min):**
1. Test audio/video quickly (record 10 sec, review)
2. Film 2-3 takes (rarely nail it first time)
3. Don't aim for perfection—authentic > polished
4. Film vertical (4:5 or 9:16) OR square (1:1) for feed optimization

**Editing (25-35 min):**
1. Select best take or combine segments
2. Cut dead air, long pauses, major mistakes
3. Add captions (critical—80% watch without sound)
4. Add text overlays for key points
5. Create custom thumbnail (face + text)
6. Export in LinkedIn-optimized format

**Publishing (10 min):**
1. Upload natively to LinkedIn (don't link to YouTube—kills reach)
2. Write caption that complements video (doesn't repeat it)
3. Add 1-2 hashtags maximum
4. Publish and engage with early comments

**Batching Strategy:**

**Option A: Film Multiple in One Session**
- Set up equipment once
- Film 3-4 videos in 90 minutes
- Edit and schedule throughout month
- Efficient but requires planning

**Option B: Weekly Production Rhythm**
- Every Tuesday morning: Film + edit week's video
- Builds routine, maintains freshness
- Topics can be timely

### Video Content Structure (Hook-Retain-Convert)

**The LinkedIn Video Algorithm:**

LinkedIn tracks:
- **Hook Success**: Do viewers watch past first 3 seconds?
- **Retention**: What % watch to end?
- **Engagement**: Likes, comments, shares

**Optimize for all three:**

**First 3 Seconds (The Hook):**

Critical. 90% of viewers decide to continue or scroll in 3 seconds.

**Hook Techniques:**

1. **Pattern Interrupt**: Bold statement
   - "I just turned down $2M. Here's why."
   - "Everyone's wrong about [topic]."

2. **Question**: Relatable problem
   - "Ever wonder why [common thing]?"
   - "What would you do in this situation?"

3. **Visual Hook**: Movement, action, surprise
   - Jump cut immediately (no slow intro)
   - Show end result first: "This is what we built. Here's how:"

4. **Data Shock**: Surprising statistic
   - "73% of startups fail because of this mistake."

**NEVER:**
- Start with "Hey guys, it's [Name] here..." (Instant scroll)
- Slow pan or fade-in (Lose viewers immediately)
- Long setup before getting to point

**Seconds 4-30 (The Setup):**

Context and promise.

- Clarify what video delivers: "In the next 60 seconds, I'll show you..."
- Establish credibility: "After 10 years building..."
- Tease value: "The framework has 3 parts. Here's part 1:"

**Seconds 31-60/90 (The Payoff):**

Deliver on promise.

Structure:
- Point 1 (20 seconds)
- Point 2 (20 seconds)
- Point 3 (20 seconds)
- Wrap-up (10 seconds)

Use on-screen text to reinforce verbal points:
[TEXT OVERLAY: "Mistake #1: Building for everyone"]

**Final 10 Seconds (The CTA):**

Clear next action.

**Engagement CTA:**
- "What's your experience? Drop a comment."
- "Agree or disagree? Let me know."

**Conversion CTA:**
- "Link to the full guide in my featured section."
- "We're hiring for [role]. Apply: [link in comments]."

**Thought Leadership CTA:**
- "Follow for more on [topic]."
- "Next video: [Tease upcoming content]."

### Captions & Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)

**80% of LinkedIn videos watched without sound.**

**Caption Requirements:**
- ✅ **Always include captions** (burned-in or LinkedIn auto-captions)
- ✅ Readable font (40pt+ for mobile)
- ✅ High contrast (white text with black outline on any background)
- ✅ Accurate (edit auto-generated for errors)

**Captioning Tools:**
- CapCut (free, auto-captions, mobile-friendly)
- Descript (paid, highly accurate transcription + editing)
- Kapwing (web-based, easy)
- LinkedIn native (auto-generated, editable after upload)

**Accessibility Benefits:**
- Deaf/hard of hearing can access
- Non-native speakers can follow
- Silent scrollers see content
- Searchable/indexable text for discovery

### Video Repurposing Strategy

**One Video → 10+ Pieces of Content:**

**From Single 90-Second Video:**

1. **LinkedIn Native**: Original upload
2. **Carousel**: Key points as 6-slide carousel
3. **Twitter/X**: Post as native video or thread
4. **Newsletter**: Embed + expand in written form
5. **Blog Post**: Transcript + additional commentary
6. **Podcast Clip**: Audio-only version
7. **Instagram**: Reformat for Reels (9:16)
8. **YouTube Short**: Same vertical format
9. **Quote Graphics**: Pull 3-5 quotes as static images
10. **Email**: Send to list with context

**Reverse Repurposing:**

- Newsletter → Summarize as 60-sec video
- LinkedIn post → Expand into video explanation
- Podcast → Pull video clips for LinkedIn

### Measurement & Optimization

**Video Performance Benchmarks:**

LinkedIn video metrics to track:

| Metric | Calculation | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Views | Auto-counts at 3 sec | 3x follower count for good video |
| 3-Second View Rate | Views / Impressions | 20-30% |
| Completion Rate | 100% watched / Started | 30-50% |
| Engagement Rate | (Reactions+Comments+Shares) / Views | 3-5% |
| Share Rate | Shares / Views | 0.5-1% |

**Diagnostic Analysis:**

- **Low Views (<1x followers)**: Hook failed, topic not relevant, or bad timing
- **Low Completion (<25%)**: Lost them after hook, content not compelling
- **High Views, Low Engagement**: Passive viewing but no action—strengthen CTA
- **High Engagement but Low Views**: Great content for core audience but not broad appeal

**A/B Testing Variables:**

Test one at a time over 8-10 videos:
- **Hook style**: Question vs. Bold statement vs. Visual surprise
- **Length**: 60 sec vs. 90 sec vs. 120 sec
- **Format**: Talking head vs. Screen recording vs. B-roll
- **Thumbnail**: Custom vs. Auto-generated
- **Caption text**: Short teaser vs. Full transcript vs. Context-adding
- **Time of posting**: Morning vs. Afternoon vs. Evening

**Iterate Based on Data:**
- If talking head outperforms screen recordings → Do more talking head
- If 60-sec videos complete better than 90-sec → Shorten content
- If custom thumbnails drive more views → Always create thumbnails

## Examples

### Example 1: Talking Head Thought Leadership (75 seconds)

**Topic**: "Why I Think Product-Market Fit is Overrated"

**Hook (3 sec)**: "Everyone obsesses over product-market fit. I think they're asking the wrong question."

**Setup (15 sec)**: "After 3 failed startups and one success, here's what I learned: PMF isn't binary. It's a spectrum. And obsessing over 'have we achieved it?' is less useful than asking 'how do we increase it?'"

**Point 1 (20 sec)**: "PMF isn't a destination. [TEXT: Not a destination] Companies at $100M ARR are still improving fit. If you're waiting for perfect fit before scaling, you'll wait forever."

**Point 2 (20 sec)**: "The question isn't 'do we have PMF?' [TEXT: Wrong question] It's 'for which customer segment do we have strongest fit?' Focus there. Expand later."

**Point 3 (15 sec)**: "I've seen companies with 'great PMF' fail due to poor execution. And okay fit with amazing execution win. [TEXT: Execution > Perfect fit] Fit matters, but it's not everything."

**CTA (7 sec)**: "What's your take? Is PMF overrated or am I crazy? Comment below."

### Example 2: Screen Recording Product Demo (90 seconds)

**Topic**: "How We Use Linear for Product Roadmap Prioritization"

**Hook (3 sec)**: [Screen shows messy Jira board] "This was our roadmap 6 months ago. [Swipe to clean Linear board] This is it now."

**Setup (12 sec)**: "We switched from Jira to Linear and built a prioritization system that actually works. Here's the 3-step framework."

**Demo (60 sec)**:
- Show step 1: How they tag issues with impact/effort scores
- Show step 2: Custom view filtering high-impact/low-effort
- Show step 3: Weekly review process

**CTA (15 sec)**: "This cut our roadmap meetings from 2 hours to 30 min. If you want the template, DM me 'ROADMAP' and I'll send it over."

### Example 3: B-Roll Culture Video (60 seconds)

**Hook (3 sec)**: [Fast cuts of team working, laughing, whiteboarding] "Here's what a day at [Company] actually looks like."

**Voiceover + B-Roll (50 sec)**:
- Morning standup footage: "We start every day with 10-min standup. Remote team on Zoom, in-office team around this table."
- Deep work footage: "Then deep work until noon. No meetings before 12pm."
- Lunch footage: "Company-provided lunch. Unwritten rule: no work talk."
- Afternoon collaboration: "Afternoons are for collaboration, customer calls, strategy."

**CTA (7 sec)**: [Founder on camera] "We're hiring. If this looks like your vibe, check our careers page. Link in comments."

---

## Success Metrics

- **View Performance**: Average 3-5x follower count per video
- **Completion Rate**: 40%+ watch to end (indicates compelling content)
- **Engagement Rate**: 5%+ on video posts (higher than typical text posts)
- **Production Efficiency**: 90-minute average production time per video
- **Consistency**: Publish on schedule 90%+ of time (miss <1 per quarter)
- **Business Impact**: 15% of DMs/opportunities mention video content
- **Format Validation**: Identify 2-3 formats that consistently outperform within 3 months

---

## Best Practices

- **Hook in 3 Seconds**: Viewers decide instantly; no slow intros
- **Always Caption**: 80% watch without sound; accessibility required
- **Mobile-First**: 70% view on phone; test on mobile before publishing
- **Authentic > Polished**: Perfect production can feel corporate; real beats slick
- **Vertical or Square**: Optimized for feed; horizontal gets cropped
- **Native Upload**: Linking to YouTube kills reach; upload directly to LinkedIn
- **Custom Thumbnails**: Increase views 2-3x vs. auto-generated
- **Test and Iterate**: Track what works for YOUR audience, not generic advice
- **Batch When Possible**: Set up once, film multiple videos for efficiency
- **Repurpose Ruthlessly**: One video → 10 content pieces across platforms

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Slow Intros**: "Hey it's [Name], today I want to talk about..." (instant scroll)
- **No Captions**: Excluding 80% who watch silently; inaccessible
- **Over-Production**: Hollywood quality that feels inauthentic for founder content
- **Inconsistent Publishing**: Video requires commitment; sporadic posting damages growth
- **Wrong Aspect Ratio**: Horizontal video on mobile feed gets tiny and ignored
- **YouTube Linking**: Posting YouTube link instead of native upload; algorithm penalizes
- **Ignoring Data**: Continuing formats/topics that underperform; let analytics guide
- **Too Long**: 3-5 min videos rarely watched to completion; respect attention spans
- **No Clear CTA**: Video ends without next step; missed conversion opportunity
- **Equipment Paralysis**: Waiting for perfect setup; iPhone + good light > no video
