## Twitter Spaces Content Strategy v1.0

**Purpose**: Design, execute, and scale Twitter Spaces (live audio conversations) that build community, establish authority, generate leads, and create repeatable content assets through strategic formatting, guest curation, and audience engagement in Twitter's real-time audio environment.

**Context**: Use this framework when leveraging Twitter Spaces for live thought leadership, community building, product launches, customer education, or relationship development. Spaces is Twitter's live audio feature enabling real-time conversations with unlimited listeners. This framework applies to founders seeking to deepen relationships beyond text, showcase expertise through discussion, generate leads through valuable conversations, or build community through regular programming. Best for accounts with 1K+ followers ready to host conversations, though smaller accounts can participate as speakers to build authority before hosting.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Live Content Architecture** - Planning, hosting, and repurposing real-time audio conversations
- **Audience Engagement Mechanics** - Driving participation, managing speakers, facilitating dialogue
- **Authority Positioning** - Showcasing expertise through conversation, not monologue
- **Guest Network Leverage** - Borrowing audiences and credibility through strategic co-hosting
- **Content Repurposing System** - Converting ephemeral audio into lasting assets
- **Community Ritual Design** - Creating regular programming that builds habit and loyalty

## Prompt

You are a live audio strategist designing a comprehensive Twitter Spaces program for **{{founder_name}}** that achieves **{{spaces_objective}}** through **{{spaces_type}}** format, running **{{frequency}}** for **{{duration}}**, reaching **{{audience_size_target}}** listeners by discussing **{{topic_category}}** with **{{guest_strategy}}** to drive measurable **{{call_to_action}}** outcomes.

### Spaces Format Templates

**Format 1: The Founder Interview**

**Structure** (60 minutes):
```
0:00-5:00 - Host intro + guest background
5:00-15:00 - Origin story (how they got started)
15:00-35:00 - Deep dive on specific topic/expertise
35:00-50:00 - Tactical takeaways and lessons
50:00-55:00 - Audience Q&A
55:00-60:00 - Wrap-up + where to follow guest
```

**When to use**:
- **{{spaces_objective}}** = Thought leadership, audience growth
- You have access to interesting founders/experts
- Audience wants to learn from others' journeys

**Host preparation**:
- Research guest thoroughly (past interviews, content, company)
- Prepare 10-12 questions (use 60%, let conversation flow)
- Identify 2-3 unique angles nobody else has asked about

**Guest value exchange**:
- They get: Exposure to your audience, platform to share
- You get: Content, their audience, association with their credibility

---

**Format 2: The Expert Panel**

**Structure** (90 minutes):
```
0:00-5:00 - Host intro, panelist intros
5:00-25:00 - Topic 1: Each panelist weighs in (5 min each)
25:00-45:00 - Topic 2: Panelists discuss + debate
45:00-65:00 - Topic 3: Tactical advice + frameworks
65:00-80:00 - Audience Q&A
80:00-90:00 - Wrap-up, where to follow panelists
```

**When to use**:
- **{{topic_category}}** = Complex topic needing multiple perspectives
- You want diverse viewpoints on stage
- Audience values debate and nuance

**Panelist selection**:
- 3-4 panelists ideal (5+ gets chaotic)
- Mix of perspectives (different industries, approaches, opinions)
- At least one person who might disagree with others (constructive tension)

**Moderation tips**:
- Set ground rules upfront (let each person finish, disagree respectfully)
- Balance airtime (track who's spoken, invite quieter voices)
- Play "devil's advocate" to surface interesting debate

---

**Format 3: The AMA (Ask Me Anything)**

**Structure** (60 minutes):
```
0:00-5:00 - Host intro, what we'll cover, how to ask questions
5:00-55:00 - Continuous Q&A from audience
55:00-60:00 - Wrap-up + final thoughts + CTA
```

**When to use**:
- **{{spaces_objective}}** = Community building, accessibility
- You have expertise audience wants to tap
- Building personal connection with followers

**Managing Q&A flow**:
- Seed first 2-3 questions yourself (get momentum going)
- Group similar questions ("Getting a lot of questions about [topic]...")
- Skip bad-faith or off-topic questions politely ("Let's stay focused on [topic]")
- Bring people on stage to ask directly (more engaging than reading questions)

**Making it valuable**:
- Be specific in answers (not generic advice)
- Share personal stories and examples
- Admit what you don't know
- Offer to follow up via DM for complex questions

---

**Format 4: The Weekly Show**

**Structure** (30-45 minutes):
```
0:00-3:00 - Cold open: "This week in [topic]" headline recap
3:00-5:00 - Intro + format overview
5:00-15:00 - Segment 1: Main topic deep-dive
15:00-25:00 - Segment 2: Guest interview or hot take
25:00-35:00 - Segment 3: Community spotlight or Q&A
35:00-40:00 - Recap + next week preview
40:00-45:00 - Post-show hangout (optional, informal)
```

**When to use**:
- **{{frequency}}** = Weekly (builds habit)
- **{{spaces_objective}}** = Community building, consistent presence
- You can commit to regular schedule

**Show elements**:
- **Consistent branding**: Same day/time, same intro format
- **Segments**: Predictable structure (people know what to expect)
- **Community involvement**: Regular listener shoutouts, questions featured
- **Guest rotation**: Mix of formats keeps it fresh

**Building habit**:
- Same day/time every week (e.g., "Tuesdays at 2 PM ET")
- Reminder tweets: 24 hrs before, 2 hrs before, going live now
- Create anticipation: "Next week we're talking about [exciting topic]"

### During Spaces: Hosting Best Practices

**Opening (First 5 Minutes):**

```
"Hey everyone, welcome! I'm [Name].

We're talking about [Topic] today.

Joined by [Guest intros with brief why they're here].

We'll cover [3 things].

At [timestamp] we'll open it up for Q&A, so drop questions in the chat or request to speak.

Let's dive in. [Guest], I want to start with you..."
```

**Maintaining Energy:**
- **Vary pacing**: Mix deep dives with quick takes
- **Use listener questions**: "Great question from [Name] in the chat..."
- **Bring people on stage**: Invite listeners up to ask questions directly
- **Acknowledge new joiners**: "Welcome to everyone just joining us"
- **Signal progress**: "We're about halfway through, going to shift to [next topic]"

**Handling Awkward Moments:**

**Dead air / awkward silence:**
"Let me rephrase that—[restate question differently]"

**Guest going too long:**
"This is gold. Before we move on, [transition to next person/topic]..."

**Off-topic tangent:**
"That's fascinating and probably worth its own Space. Let's bookmark that and get back to [main topic]."

**Troll or disruptive speaker:**
[Remove speaker, don't engage publicly]

**Technical difficulties:**
"Looks like [Guest] is having audio issues. While they reconnect, let me [fill time with related point]..."

---

### Audience Engagement Tactics

**Increasing Participation:**

**Pre-Stage Invitation:**
```
"If you have a question about [topic], request to speak and I'll bring you up after [Guest] finishes this point."
```

**Direct Invitations:**
```
"I see [Name] in the audience. [Name], you've built [relevant experience]—want to weigh in on this?"
```

**Chat Engagement:**
```
"Drop a 🔥 in the chat if you've experienced this."
"Type your biggest [topic] challenge in the chat and we'll address top ones."
```

**Polls (if topic suits):**
```
"Quick poll: How many of you are currently using [tool/approach]? React with ✋"
```

**Making Listeners Feel Valued:**
- Say their name when reading questions
- Thank people for requesting to speak
- Credit good questions ("That's such a good question")
- Follow up: "DM me after and I'll send you [resource]"

- **Too Many Speakers**: 5+ panelists = chaos and nobody gets depth
- **No Moderation**: Letting one person dominate or go off-topic
- **Ignoring Chat**: Listeners feel invisible if you never reference chat
- **Poor Audio Setup**: Echo, background noise, or connectivity issues
- **No Clear CTA**: Space ends with no next action for listeners
- **Forgetting to Record**: Lose content asset (if you want replay value)
- **Inconsistent Schedule**: Starting weekly then disappearing kills momentum
- **All Talk, No Interaction**: Monologuing instead of facilitating conversation
- **No Post-Space Content**: Missed opportunity to extend reach and value
