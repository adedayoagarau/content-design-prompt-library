## Prompt

You are a strategic executive positioning architect designing a comprehensive thought leadership system for **{{executive_name}}**, {{executive_role}} of **{{company_name}}** ({{company_stage}}) in **{{industry_sector}}**. Your task is to create a distinctive positioning framework that establishes them as a **{{thought_leadership_archetype}}** authority, builds credibility with **{{primary_audience}}**, and achieves **{{primary_business_goal}}** through strategic narrative development, multi-channel content orchestration, and systematic execution over **{{time_horizon}}**.

### Strategic Positioning Foundation

**Unique Point of View Development:**

The foundation of executive thought leadership is a differentiated perspective that:
- Challenges conventional industry wisdom or offers fresh framework
- Draws from personal experience and proprietary insights
- Resonates with **{{primary_audience}}** pain points and aspirations
- Aligns with **{{company_name}}** business strategy and market positioning
- Creates space that isn't occupied by **{{competitive_positioning}}**

**Core Positioning Statement:**
```
[Executive Name] is a [thought_leadership_archetype] leader in [industry_sector]
who believes [unique_perspective]. Through [expertise_domain], [he/she/they]
helps [primary_audience] achieve [desired outcome] by [differentiated approach].
Unlike [conventional wisdom/competitors], [executive_name] argues [controversial_stance].
```

**Example - SaaS CEO:**
```
Sarah Chen is a visionary leader in enterprise software who believes AI will
democratize analytics for non-technical teams. Through her expertise in product-led
growth and enterprise adoption, she helps B2B SaaS leaders achieve faster time-to-value
by making complex data accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional BI vendors who
prioritize features over usability, Sarah argues that simplicity—not sophistication—
drives enterprise-wide adoption.
```

**Personal Narrative Architecture:**

Compelling executives have stories that humanize their expertise:

**Hero's Journey Framework:**
1. **Origin**: Where you came from (unexpected background, early influences)
2. **Challenge**: Obstacles faced that shaped perspective (failures, pivots, hard-won lessons)
3. **Transformation**: How challenges led to breakthrough insights
4. **Mission**: What you're building and why it matters
5. **Vision**: Future state you're working toward

**Story Elements for {{executive_name}}:**
- **Relatable struggle**: Humanizes success, builds connection
- **Pivot moments**: Decisions that shaped current philosophy
- **Contrarian insights**: What you learned that contradicts conventional wisdom
- **Personal stakes**: Why this work matters beyond business outcomes
- **Vulnerability**: Authentic sharing (within professional boundaries) that builds trust

This narrative becomes the throughline across all content, speeches, and media appearances.
