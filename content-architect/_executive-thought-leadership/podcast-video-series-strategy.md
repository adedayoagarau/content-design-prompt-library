## Podcast & Video Series Strategy for Executive Thought Leadership v1.0

**Purpose**: Design a comprehensive podcast and video content strategy that positions executives as authoritative voices through long-form audio/visual thought leadership, builds owned audience assets, generates repurposable content at scale, and drives measurable business outcomes while integrating seamlessly with broader executive positioning.

**Context**: Use this framework when launching or optimizing an executive's podcast/video presence—whether hosting your own show, strategically guesting on others', or combining both approaches. Ideal for executives who need to demonstrate depth of expertise beyond short-form social media, build relationships through interviews, create evergreen content assets, and reach audiences who prefer audio/video consumption. Particularly powerful for technical subjects requiring explanation, relationship-driven industries, and executives building long-term authority.

**Strategic Frameworks Applied**:
- **Format Selection Matrix** - Choosing optimal podcast/video format for goals and resources
- **Guest Strategy Architecture** - Strategic guest selection for relationship building and audience growth
- **Production & Distribution System** - Scalable workflow from recording to multi-channel distribution
- **Content Repurposing Engine** - Maximizing ROI from each episode across all channels
- **Audience Development Model** - Growing and retaining engaged listener/viewer base
- **Business Impact Attribution** - Connecting podcast/video to measurable outcomes
